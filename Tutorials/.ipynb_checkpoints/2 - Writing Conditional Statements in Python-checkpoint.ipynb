    "# Tutorial: Writing Conditional Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of writing conditional statements in Python. Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. We will cover the basic syntax and usage of `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements. Let's get started!"
